    fullText: "There are instances when there is a breach in the system(s) of the company leading to theft or modification with confidential data of the company. This is an extremely serious matter because in the current digital age, every big or small data exists mostly in hard drives or cloud storages and any such incident could lead to divulgence of important information that is specific to the company. This could be the outcome of infiltration by domestic staff or hacking of the data by hackers. In any case, it is rather important that the countermeasures are taken as soon as possible to avoid incurring any further damages Cyber Forensics is the department that specializes in running investigations to backtrack the activities to reach the source of the breach. The investigation is done with the help of proprietary investigation softwares. Special attention is given to the system on which the investigation is done. A copy of the all the files in the original system is prepared and is locked away in a safe so that it can be presented in the court. The rest of the research is run in the copy of the original."
